#Exercise 1
A p value is the probability of obtaining results given that the null hypothesis is true. 
In this case, the null hypothesis is that a positive test result indicates that a person has HIV. 
If someone gets a positive result, there is a 5% chance that the individual does not have HIV (null hypothesis is false).
This would not be statistically significant if we are setting the p value threshold to be under 0.05 (5%).

#Exercise 2
Because there is no false negative rate, the probability that a person will get a positive test if they are infected is 100%.
